# React Notes

## What is React?
- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
- React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

## Key Features
- **Components**: React is all about components. A component is a self-contained module that renders some output.
- **JSX**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML.
- **Virtual DOM**: React creates a virtual DOM to improve performance. It updates only the parts of the DOM that have changed.
- **State Management**: React provides a way to manage the state of an application using `useState` and `useReducer` hooks.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: React components have lifecycle methods that you can override to run code at particular times in the process.

## Basic Concepts
- **Components**: The building blocks of a React application. They can be functional or class-based.
- **Props**: Short for properties, props are read-only attributes used to pass data from parent to child components.
- **State**: A built-in object that stores property values that belong to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
- **Hooks**: Functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.

## Example Code

### Functional Component
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
                Click me
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Class Component
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Counter extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
                <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
                    Click me
                </button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Counter;
```
